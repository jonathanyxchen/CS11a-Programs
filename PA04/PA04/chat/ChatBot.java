Now it's the chance for you to build your own pizza!ï¼ˆFor any words 
indicating the intention of the user to bue pizza here, it would

it would randomly the request for the kind of sauce user wants)

asd
Sorry, we don't have this for our ordering. Please check www.dominos.com for details.
(If the answer is not listed of any kind, it would give this answer)

asd
Earlier you said handmade pan is that still true?(At any time, the program might ask
if a specific answer the user gave before is still true or not)
Sorry, we don't have this for our ordering. Please check www.dominos.com for details.



Explanation of the program:
The challenge of the program is mainly put the previous answers in an array and 
ask if it's still ture later randomly. I asked one of my friends and we figured out together. 
My intention of designing this program is that I ordered domino pizza very often through their
website and I feel a chat bot would make the ordering process more interesting. If I have more
time, I would design more functions for ordering, as for this program, users can order pizza only, 
and it's very likely that the user would type in a word that is not listed as any kind.
